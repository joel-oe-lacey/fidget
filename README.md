# Sequence : A Fidget Game 
If you’re anything like me you might have a hyperactive mind. I find my mind stays more engaged when I perform simple mechanical tasks in the background while I’m  watching talks, listening to podcasts or doing anything that doesn't require my full attention.

Fidget is designed to key into that, it displays a direction, and you simply push the corresponding arrow key. It tracks your score and allows you to stay honed in on whatever you're learning about.

## Development
This project is React based, it is set up with Redux for global state management to allow for future extension. Keystroke detection and dynamic display are achieved through React Hooks.

As this was quickly put together, I aimed at a few specific learning goals and basic MVP generation. I used the opportunity to play around with keystoke detection and some conditional styling points, as well as diving into custom hooks. 

## Future Iterations
Given the limited time this was developed in there are several points where the UX/UI could be improved:
- Transition animations and visual indication would add some additional flair.
- I would like to add more features such as score multipliers, and a shop.
- I would also like to add error tracking, and streak tracking.
